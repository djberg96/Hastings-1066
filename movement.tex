\section{Movement}

GENERAL RULE:

During the movement segment of a Battle Turn, the phasing player can move as many or as few of his units as he wishes, in any direction or combination of directions. Each unit has a \textit{movement allowance} (5.12) that can be restricted by its Battle Order. Normally, however, each unit can spend as many of its movement points (MPs) as desired within the limits of its movement allowance.

PROCEDURE:

Units are moved one at a time, tracing a path of contiguous hexes through the hex grid. As a unit enters a hex or crosses a hexside, it must pay part of its movement allowance. These costs are listed on the Terrain Effects Chart on the map.

\subsection{How to Move}

\subsubsection[Movement Calculation]{} Movement is calculated in terms of hexes. Basically, each unit spends one movement point for each hex that it enters. Some hexes and hexsides cost additional movement points to enter or cross, as listed on the Terrain Effects Chart.

\subsubsection[Movement Costs]{} The movement costs for all units are as follows:

    & 6 MP (charging) \\
    Leader & 6 MP \\
    All Others (Foot, Bowmen, etc) & 3 MP \\
