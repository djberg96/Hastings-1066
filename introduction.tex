\section{INTRODUCTION}
\hfill

The \textit{Hastings: 1066} game is a tactical simulation of the confrontation between William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy, and King Harold Godwineson of Wessex, a battle that forever changed the face of the world. William and his combined force of Normans, Bretons, French and Flemings, is moving on London. His way is blocked by the hastily assembled Saxon army of Harold, fresh from victory over the Danes at Stamford Bridge. The victor will be king of England.

In this game, the armies are divided into \textit{nationalities} (Normans) or \textit{wings} (Saxons). The ability of each nationality or wing to move and attack is restricted by the formation or \textit{order} it adopts. These are influenced by the \textit{strategy} each player selects at the start of each game turn. Over the course of the battle, the choice of strategy will cummulatively affect the fatigue level and morale of the troops. The details of this process are given in Section 4.0 of these rules.
