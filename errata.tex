\subsection{Counters}

Two red (Norman) foot units were printed with \textbf{"D"} morale on their front side, they should have a \textbf{"C"} morale (their reverse side is correct). Two additional red (Norman) foot units have \textbf{"D"} morale on their reverse side, they should have a \textbf{"C"} morale (their front side is correct).

One brown (Saxon \textit{Housecarl}) unit has a \textbf{7-8/3-A-8} print on its front side. It should read \textbf{7-5/3-A-8}, identical to the other Saxon \textit{Housecarl} units (the reverse side is correct).

\subsection{Map/Charts}

Setup: There is one extra \textbf{"FF"} (Franco-Flemish Foot) set-up hex; ignore hex \textbf{1307}.

On the "Norman Battle Order Determination Table, 4.46", in the "Foot Battle Order" section, line-through the words \textbf{"Aggressive"} after "Shield Wall" and \textbf{"Moderate"} after "Melee/Fire". They have no meaning.
