# Hastings-1066
This is a Recreation of the *Hastings: 1066* rulebook from Strategy & Tactics Magazine, Nr. 110.

It does not currently contain any images, though there are not many in the original rules anyway.

Other than fixing one or two minor typos, consistent spelling of "Housecarl", and inclusion of the official errata, this text is identical to the magazine rules.
