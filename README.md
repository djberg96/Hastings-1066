# Hastings-1066
This is a Recreation of the *Hastings: 1066* rulebook from Strategy & Tactics Magazine, Nr. 110.

Custom color unit images replace the original black & white images from the rulebook. They are very similar but not quite identical. Some other images, such as facing and missile fire, have not yet been added.

Other than fixing one or two minor typos, consistent spelling of "Housecarl", and inclusion of the official errata and one or two personal comments, this text is mostly identical to the magazine rules. I did make a minor numbering scheme change that follows more modern rulebooks where a sub-subsection like e.g. 3.31 is instead numbered 3.3.1, but that's about it.

To generate the rules run the command `pdflatex --jobname=Hastings_1066 main.tex`, which will generate a "Hastings_1066.pdf" file. You can, of course, change the name to whatever you like.

Installing pdflatex will depend on your operating system. I leave that as an exercise to the reader.
